    <p id="ColouredParagraph">After many requests, today I am finally going to answer the question I have posed for many years, Spider-Man: Threat or Menace? Yes, that's right. It's time I'm taking a position, and that position is? He's both! Sometimes he's a threatening menace and sometimes he's a menacing threat, but <b>COME ON,</b> how can you <i>menace</i> someone without also being a <i>threat</i> and vice-versa. And for those <b>GRAMMAR NAZIS</b> among you who say I'm being redundant, it's called <b>ART!</b> I'm a <b>WORDSMITH!</b> It's a rhetorical device, and if you don't like it, I'll tell you where you can shove that device!!!</p>
